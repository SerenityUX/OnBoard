# PCB Circle Art Piece

I made a mini-PCB art piece. You can hand it on your wall. It will be programmed to take you to my contact info (or maybe other purpose, will decide software later). It's meant primarily to be visually appealing.

It's going to cost $84.90 (about four dollars per board). I am making 20 boards. The purpose is this is that I am going to share the boards with friends, HQ folks, & family as a gift. 

I turned some AI art I made into an SVG & slapped some text onto it. It's meant to be pretty fun & playful.
